<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p><img src="IMG_3992.jpg" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="301px" height="295px" border="0" class="img_1setup"></p>
<p>Hi Founders and Coders - thanks for taking the time to read through my application! I'm a 27-year-old from South London. After having spent 5 years working in B2B technology marketing, I'm looking for a change, and programming has been something I've been considering as an option for some time. </p> 
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I graduated from Keele University with a degree in business and marketing in 2018, and found a job in B2B marketing immediately. While I enjoyed the work and working with a lovely team, it was clear that my personality is suited to technical problem-solving work. Throughout my spare time in my twenties I have had a strong interest in music technology and music production, so I took a career break in April 2022 to pursue becoming a full-time musician and producer.  </p>
<h1>Why software engineering? </h1>
<p> During my time working as a musician over the past 18 months I have, once again, found myself gravitating towards the technical elements of the job; music mixing, along with experimenting with the creation of my own software instrument using Native Instruments' Kontakt KSP scripting language (https://www.native-instruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/downloads/manuals/kontakt/KONTAKT_602_KSP_Reference_Manual.pdf). Using KSP I created my own software synth which I have recently released commercially, available here: https://batterseaaudio.co.uk/polygrade </p>
<h1>What have I learnt so far? </h1>
<p> Aside from my Kontakt scripting work, I have also spent time experimenting with C++, including doing an introductory course at Kadenze.com on audio plugin development using C++. As I continue with my first programming job I intend to continue developing audio plugins in my free time, in order to develop a portfolio. </p>
<p> I have really enjoyed working through the codewars challenges during my application, along with the java game and learning web development basics. I am excited to create a solid foundational understanding of HTML, Javascript, and CSS if I am accepted into the Founders & Coders course. 
<h1>My Game </h1>
<p> I hope you enjoy playing my game! As a kid, I spent lots of time spending very basic games over at Miniclip.com and similar websites. My game was designed based on what I learned about Javascript independently, with influence from the games I played as a child. </p>
